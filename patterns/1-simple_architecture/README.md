# AWS Cloud WAN Blueprints - Simple architecture

Within this section of the blueprints, we want to provide a simple example of AWS Cloud WAN, so you can understand its basic concepts: segments, segment actions, and attachment policies. The use case covered builds the following:

- Two AWS Regions, three [segments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-manager/latest/cloudwan/cloudwan-policy-segments.html).
    - *production* and *shared* segment are isolated, meaning that VPCs within this segment won't be able to talk between each other.
    - *development* segment, where VPCs will be able to talk between each other within the segment.
- A [share segment action]() will allow VPCs in the *shared* segment to talk with *production* and *development*.
- Two [attachment policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-manager/latest/cloudwan/cloudwan-policy-attachments.html):
    - First rule (100) will check that the attachment type is VPC, and that the tag with a key `domain` exists. If both conditions are met, it will check the value of the tag `domain`, and it will associate the attachment to a segment with the same name.
    - Second rule (200) will check if the attachment has a tag equals to `domain = sharedservice`. If true, it will associate the attachment to the segment *shared*.

**Note** that in this section we are not covering *service insertion*, as this routing configuration is covered in detail in the [Traffic inspection architectures](../3-traffic_inspection/) section.
