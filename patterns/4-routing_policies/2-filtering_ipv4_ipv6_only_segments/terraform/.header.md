# AWS Cloud WAN IPv4/IPv6 Segment Filtering (Terraform)

![IPv4-IPv6 Segments](../../../../images/patterns_filtering_ipv4_ipv6_segments.png)

## Prerequisites

- **AWS Account**: With appropriate IAM permissions
- **Terraform**: >= 1.3.0 installed
- **AWS CLI**: Configured with credentials (optional, for verification)
- **Permissions required**:
  - Network Manager
  - EC2: VPC, subnets, instances, endpoints
  - IAM: Create roles and policies

## Deployment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cloud-wan-blueprints.git

# Navigate to the Terraform directory
cd patterns/4-routing_policies/2-filtering_ipv4_ipv6_only_segments/terraform

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# (Optional) Review the planned changes
terraform plan

# Deploy the resources
terraform apply
```

> **Note**: EC2 instances will be deployed in all the Availability Zones configured for each VPC. Keep this in mind when testing this environment from a cost perspective - for production environments, we recommend the use of at least 2 AZs for high-availability.

## Cleanup

```bash
# Destroy all resources
terraform destroy
```

## Next Steps

After successfully deploying this pattern:

1. **Explore the architecture**: Review segment sharing with routing policies in Network Manager console
2. **Test connectivity**: Verify IPv4-only and IPv6-only segments receive appropriate routes
3. **Try modifications**: Add more protocol-specific segments, test dual-stack connectivity
