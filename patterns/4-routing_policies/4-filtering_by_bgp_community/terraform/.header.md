# AWS Cloud WAN BGP Community Filtering (Terraform)

![Filtering BGP Community](../../../../images/patterns_filtering_bgp_community.png)

> **⚠️ Hybrid Environment Required**: This pattern requires you to establish hybrid connectivity (Site-to-Site VPN or Connect attachment) with BGP configuration to test end-to-end. The IaC code creates the Cloud WAN infrastructure, but you must configure your on-premises router to advertise routes with BGP communities.

## Prerequisites

- **AWS Account**: With appropriate IAM permissions
- **Terraform**: >= 1.3.0 installed
- **AWS CLI**: Configured with credentials (optional, for verification)
- **Permissions required**:
  - Network Manager
  - EC2: VPC, subnets, instances, endpoints
  - IAM: Create roles and policies
- **Hybrid Connectivity**: Site-to-Site VPN or Connect attachment for full testing

## Deployment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cloud-wan-blueprints.git

# Navigate to the Terraform directory
cd patterns/4-routing_policies/4-filtering_by_bgp_community/terraform

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# (Optional) Review the planned changes
terraform plan

# Deploy the resources
terraform apply
```

> **Note**: For end-to-end testing, establish Site-to-Site VPN or Connect attachment with BGP communities (65052:100 for development, 65051:100 for test) - you will need to change BGP community values in the Core Network policy if you want to use other values. EC2 instances will be deployed in all the Availability Zones configured for each VPC. Keep this in mind when testing this environment from a cost perspective - for production environments, we recommend the use of at least 2 AZs for high-availability.

## Cleanup

```bash
# Destroy all resources
terraform destroy
```

## Next Steps

After successfully deploying this pattern:

1. **Explore the architecture**: Review routing policies and segment sharing in Network Manager console
2. **Test connectivity**: Establish hybrid connectivity and verify BGP community filtering
3. **Try modifications**: Add more BGP communities, create additional segments
