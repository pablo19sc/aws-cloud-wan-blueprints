# AWS Cloud WAN Blueprints - Routing Policies

## Overview

This section demonstrates advanced routing policy capabilities in AWS Cloud WAN, providing fine-grained control over route filtering, summarization, and BGP configuration control across your global network. Routing policies enable you to implement sophisticated routing scenarios that go beyond basic segment connectivity.

**Use these patterns to**:

- Filter unwanted routes from your attachments (secondary CIDRs, specific prefixes), between segments, or between AWS Regions
- Segment hybrid traffic using BGP communities
- Influence traffic paths between regions using AS-PATH manipulation
- Implement advanced routing controls for complex network architectures

## 1. Filtering Secondary CIDR Blocks in VPC Attachments

This pattern shows how you can filters secondary CIDR blocks from VPC attachments to prevent internal-only ranges from propagating to the broader network. VPCs often have secondary CIDR blocks for internal-only traffic (e.g., Kubernetes pod networks, cluster communication). These ranges should not propagate to avoid undesired routing behaviors.

### Key Components

| Component | Configuration |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Regions** | us-east-1, eu-west-1 |
| **Segments** | `production`, `development` |
| **Routing Policy** | Filter 10.100.0.0/16 (secondary CIDR) |
| **Policy Direction** | `inbound` (VPC attachments only support inbound) |
| **Policy Association** | To attachments via routing policy label `vpcAttachments` |

### Traffic Flow

| Source | Destination | Result | Reason |
|--------|-------------|--------|--------|
| Production VPC A | Production VPC B | ✅ Allowed | Primary CIDR blocks propagated to segment |
| Development VPC A | Development VPC B | ✅ Allowed | Primary CIDR blocks propagated to segment |
| Production VPC | Development VPC | ❌ Blocked | No segment sharing |

## 2. Creating IPv4 and IPv6 Only Segments

This patterns shows how you can create protocol-specific segments by filtering IPv4 or IPv6 routes when sharing between dual-stack and single-stack segments. You may want to take advantage of the filtering capability when sharing segments when dual-stack VPCs need to share routes with protocol-specific segments for specialized workloads or compliance requirements (e.g., IPv6-only applications, legacy IPv4-only systems).

![IPv4-IPv6 Segments](../../images/patterns_filtering_ipv4_ipv6_segments.png)

### Key Components

| Component | Configuration |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Regions** | us-east-1, eu-west-1 |
| **Segments** | `production`, `development` (dual-stack), `ipv4only`, `ipv6only` |
| **Routing Policies** | `filterIpv4` (drops 0.0.0.0/0), `filterIpv6` (drops ::/0) |
| **Policy Direction** | `inbound` |
| **Segment Actions** | Share with filtering between dual-stack and single-stack |

### Traffic Flow

| Source | Destination | Result | Route Filtering | Reason |
|--------|-------------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Prod/Dev VPC (IPv4) | ipv4only segment VPC (IPv4) | ✅ Allowed | ✅ IPv4 allowed | IPv6 routes filtered, IPv4 routes shared |
| Prod/Dev VPC (IPv6) | ipv4only segment VPC | ❌ Blocked | ❌ IPv6 filtered | IPv6 routes dropped by `filterIpv6` policy |
| Prod/Dev VPC (IPv6) | ipv6only segment VPC (IPv6) | ✅ Allowed | ✅ IPv6 allowed | IPv4 routes filtered, IPv6 routes shared |
| Prod/Dev VPC (IPv4) | ipv6only segment VPC | ❌ Blocked | ❌ IPv4 filtered | IPv4 routes dropped by `filterIpv4` policy |
| Production VPC | Production VPC | ❌ Blocked | N/A | No segment sharing |
| ipv4only VPC | ipv6only VPC | ❌ Blocked | N/A | No segment sharing |

## 3. Traffic Inspection After Filtering

This pattern demonstrates how routing policies can be applied at the attachment layer to filter routes before applying Service Insertion rules for traffic inspection. This is particularly useful when you need to filter unwanted routes (such as secondary CIDR blocks) while still maintaining traffic inspection between segments.

**Important Limitation**: Routing policies cannot be directly applied to Network Function Groups (NFGs) or service insertion flows. However, this pattern shows how to work around this limitation by applying routing policies at the attachment level before traffic enters the inspection path.

![Inspection after Filtering](../../images/patterns_inspection_after_filtering.png)

### Key Components

| Component | Configuration |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Regions** | us-east-1, eu-west-1 |
| **Segments** | `production`, `development` |
| **Network Function Group** | `inspectionVpcs` (for AWS Network Firewall) |
| **Routing Policy** | Filter secondary CIDR blocks (100.64.0.0/16), allow 10.0.0.0/8 |
| **Policy Direction** | `inbound` (at VPC attachments) |
| **Service Insertion** | `send-via` dual-hop inspection between segments |

### How It Works

**Scenario**:

- Production and development VPCs in two regions with primary CIDRs (10.0.0.0/8) and secondary CIDRs (100.64.0.0/16)
- Traffic between production and development segments must be inspected by AWS Network Firewall.
- Secondary CIDR blocks should not propagate to other segments.

**Solution**:

1. Apply routing policy `allowCidrRange` at VPC attachment level using routing policy label `vpcAttachments`:
   - Allow routes in 10.0.0.0/8 range (primary CIDRs)
   - Drop all other routes (including 100.64.0.0/16 secondary CIDRs)
2. Create Network Function Group `inspectionVpcs` for inspection VPCs with AWS Network Firewall.
3. Configure `send-via` segment action to route traffic from production to development through inspection VPCs.
4. Filtered routes (primary CIDRs only) are then subject to service insertion rules.

### Traffic Flow

| Source | Destination | Route Type | Result | Reason |
|--------|-------------|------------|--------|--------|
| Production VPC (10.0.x.x) | Development VPC (10.10.x.x) | Primary CIDR | ✅ Allowed + Inspected | Route allowed by policy, then inspected via send-via |
| Production VPC (100.64.x.x) | Development VPC | Secondary CIDR | ❌ Blocked | Secondary CIDR filtered by routing policy |
| Development VPC (10.10.x.x) | Production VPC (10.0.x.x) | Primary CIDR | ✅ Allowed + Inspected | Route allowed by policy, then inspected via send-via |
| Development VPC (100.64.x.x) | Production VPC | Secondary CIDR | ❌ Blocked | Secondary CIDR filtered by routing policy |

## 4. Filtering Routes Using BGP Communities

> **⚠️ Hybrid Environment Required**: This pattern requires you to establish hybrid connectivity (Site-to-Site VPN or Connect attachment) with BGP configuration to test end-to-end. The IaC code creates the Cloud WAN infrastructure, but you must configure your on-premises router to advertise routes with BGP communities.

This pattern shows how you can segment hybrid traffic by routing domain using BGP communities, allowing a single BGP session to announce all on-premises routes while maintaining logical separation.

It's common practice to maintain traffic segmentation in hybrid environments (development, test, production). However, before routing policies in Cloud WAN, this segmentation required a single BGP session per routing domain. While you can still follow that approach, if you want to simplify the configuration and operation of your hybrid communication, you can tag your routes with BGP communities under a single BGP session, and Cloud WAN filters them to different segments.

![Filtering BGP Community](../../images/patterns_filtering_bgp_community.png)

### Key Components

| Component | Configuration |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Regions** | us-east-1, eu-west-1 |
| **Segments** | `development`, `test`, `hybrid` |
| **Routing Policies** | Filter routes by BGP community (65052:100, 65051:100) |
| **Policy Direction** | `outbound` |
| **Hybrid Attachments** | Site-to-Site VPN or Connect |

### How It Works

1. On-premises router tags routes with BGP communities:
   - Development routes: 65052:100
   - Test routes: 65051:100
2. Single BGP session announces all routes to hybrid segment
3. Routing policies filter routes when sharing to workload segments:
   - Development segment receives only 65052:100 routes
   - Test segment receives only 65051:100 routes

### BGP Configuration Example

```
! On-premises router
route-map DEV-ROUTES permit 10
 match ip address prefix-list DEV-PREFIXES
 set community 65052:100

route-map TEST-ROUTES permit 10
 match ip address prefix-list TEST-PREFIXES
 set community 65051:100
```

### Traffic Flow

| Source | Destination | BGP Community | Result | Reason |
|--------|-------------|---------------|--------|--------|
| On-premises (Dev) | Development VPC | 65052:100 | ✅ Allowed | Community matches development filter |
| On-premises (Dev) | Test VPC | 65052:100 | ❌ Blocked | Community doesn't match test filter |
| On-premises (Test) | Test VPC | 65051:100 | ✅ Allowed | Community matches test filter |
| On-premises (Test) | Development VPC | 65051:100 | ❌ Blocked | Community doesn't match development filter |
| Development VPC | Test VPC | N/A | ❌ Blocked | No segment sharing |

## 5. Influencing Hybrid Path Between AWS Regions

> **⚠️ Hybrid Environment Required**: This pattern requires you to establish two hybrid connections (Site-to-Site VPN or Connect attachments) in different AWS regions, both announcing the same route prefix. The IaC code creates the Cloud WAN infrastructure, but you must configure your on-premises routers to establish BGP sessions and advertise routes.

This pattern shows how you can influences traffic paths between AWS Regions when multiple hybrid connections announce the same routes, using AS-PATH prepending to control path selection. 

With hybrid connections in multiple AWS Regions announcing the same CIDR range, you need to control which path traffic takes between AWS regions. This pattern uses AS-PATH manipulation (in Cloud WAN) to make one path less preferred.

![Hybrid Path Influence](../../images/patterns_influencing_path_between_regions.png)

### Key Components

| Component | Configuration |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Regions** | us-east-1, eu-west-1, eu-west-2 |
| **Segments** | `vpcs`, `hybrid` |
| **Routing Policy** | Prepend ASNs 65500, 65501 to routes from ASN 65052 |
| **Policy Direction** | `outbound` (on CNE-to-CNE peering) |
| **Hybrid Connections** | us-east-1 (ASN 65052), eu-west-2 (ASN 65058) |

### How It Works

**Scenario**:

- Hybrid connection in us-east-1 (ASN 65052) and eu-west-2 (ASN 65058) announces the same CIDR range
- Goal: Make eu-west-1 prefer eu-west-2 path (only in the `vpcs` segment)

**Solution**:

1. Routing policy matches routes with ASN 65052 in AS-PATH
2. Prepends ASNs 65500 and 65501 to those routes
3. Applied to us-east-1 ↔ eu-west-1 CNE peering (only in the `vpcs` segment)
4. eu-west-1 sees longer AS-PATH via us-east-1, prefers eu-west-2

### Traffic Flow

| Source | Path via us-east-1 | Path via eu-west-2 | Selected Path |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **eu-west-1 VPC** | 65000 → 65500, 65501, 65052 (length: 4) | 65002 → 65058 (length: 2) | ✅ eu-west-2 (shorter) |
| **us-east-1 VPC** | 65052 (local, length: 1) | 65002 → 65058 (length: 2) | ✅ us-east-1 (local) |
| **eu-west-2 VPC** | 65000 → 65052 (length: 2) | 65058 (local, length: 1) | ✅ eu-west-2 (local) |

## 6. Influencing Direct Connect Gateway (DXGW) Hybrid Path

> **⚠️ Hybrid Environment Required**: This pattern requires you to establish Direct Connect connections and Virtual Interfaces (VIFs) through two Direct Connect Gateways (DXGWs) in different geographical locations, all announcing the same route prefix. The IaC code creates the Cloud WAN infrastructure and DXGWs, but you must configure your on-premises routers to establish BGP sessions and advertise routes.

This pattern shows how you can use routing policies to prefer a specific hybrid path when multiple DXGWs announce the same routes from different geographical locations. This is particularly useful if you have different DXGWs for different regional connectivity, and you want VPCs to exit through their closest Direct Connect path (defined by you) while using other Direct Connect connections as failover.

![Influencing DXGW hybrid path](../../images/patterns_influencing_dxgw_hybrid_path.png)

### Key Components

| Component | Configuration |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Regions** | us-east-1, eu-west-1 |
| **Segments** | `europevpcs`, `usvpcs`, `hybrid` |
| **Routing Policies** | Prepend ASNs 65500, 65501 to routes from specific DXGWs |
| **Policy Direction** | `outbound` (on segment sharing) |
| **Direct Connect Gateways** | Europe DXGW (ASN 64512), US DXGW (ASN 64513) |

### How It Works

**Scenario**:

- Europe DXGW (ASN 64512) and US DXGW (ASN 64513) both announce the same on-premises CIDR range
- Goal: Make European VPCs prefer Europe DXGW path, and US VPCs prefer US DXGW path

**Solution**:

1. Create separate segments for European VPCs (`europevpcs`) and US VPCs (`usvpcs`)
2. Both DXGWs attach to the `hybrid` segment
3. When sharing routes from `hybrid` to `europevpcs`:
   - Apply routing policy `addASPathUS` that prepends ASNs to routes from US DXGW (ASN 64513)
   - European VPCs see longer AS-PATH via US DXGW, prefer Europe DXGW
4. When sharing routes from `hybrid` to `usvpcs`:
   - Apply routing policy `addASPathEurope` that prepends ASNs to routes from Europe DXGW (ASN 64512)
   - US VPCs see longer AS-PATH via Europe DXGW, prefer US DXGW

### Traffic Flow

| Source | Path via Europe DXGW | Path via US DXGW | Selected Path |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|---------------|
| **eu-west-1 VPC** | 64512 (length: 1) | 65500, 65501, 64513 (length: 3) | ✅ Europe DXGW (shorter) |
| **us-east-1 VPC** | 65500, 65501, 64512 (length: 3) | 64513 (length: 1) | ✅ US DXGW (shorter) |

## 7. Route Summarization (Hybrid Attachments)

> **⚠️ Hybrid Environment Required**: This pattern requires you to establish hybrid connectivity (Site-to-Site VPN, Connect attachment, or Direct Connect Gateway) with BGP configuration to test end-to-end. The IaC code creates the Cloud WAN infrastructure, but you must configure your on-premises router to establish BGP sessions.

This pattern demonstrates how to use Cloud WAN's route summarization capability to aggregate multiple specific routes into a single summary route when advertising to hybrid connections. This is particularly useful for reducing the size of routing tables on on-premises routers and simplifying route management.

![Summarization](../../images/patterns_summarization.png)

### Key Components

| Component | Configuration |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Regions** | us-east-1, eu-west-1 |
| **Segments** | `production`, `development`, `hybrid` |
| **Routing Policy** | Summarize IPv4 routes to 10.0.0.0/8 |
| **Policy Direction** | `outbound` (to hybrid attachments) |

### How It Works

**Scenario**:

- Multiple VPCs across regions with IPv4 CIDR blocks (10.0.0.0/24, 10.0.1.0/24, 10.10.0.0/24, 10.10.1.0/24)
- VPCs are dual-stack with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
- Goal: Advertise a single summary route (10.0.0.0/8) to on-premises instead of individual VPC CIDRs

**Solution**:

1. Create a managed prefix list containing all VPC IPv4 CIDR blocks
2. Associate the prefix list with the Core Network using alias `ipv4routes`
3. Create routing policy `summarizeIpv4Routes` that:
   - Matches routes in the prefix list
   - Summarizes them to 10.0.0.0/8
4. Apply policy to hybrid attachments using routing policy label `hybridAttachment`
5. IPv6 routes are advertised without summarization

### Traffic Flow

| Route Type | Without Summarization | With Summarization | Result |
|------------|----------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **IPv4 Routes** | 10.0.0.0/24, 10.0.1.0/24, 10.10.0.0/24, 10.10.1.0/24 | 10.0.0.0/8 | ✅ Summarized |
| **IPv6 Routes** | Individual VPC IPv6 CIDRs | Individual VPC IPv6 CIDRs | ℹ️ Not summarized |

### Important Notes

1. **Prefix List Association Region**: The prefix list association MUST be created in `us-west-2` (Cloud WAN's home region), regardless of where your Core Network edge locations are deployed.

2. **Routing Policy Label**: After deployment, hybrid attachments (Site-to-Site VPN, Connect, or Direct Connect Gateway) MUST have the routing policy label `hybridAttachment` added for the summarization policy to be applied.

3. **Dual-Stack Behavior**: This pattern demonstrates summarization for IPv4 routes only. IPv6 routes are advertised without summarization.

4. **Supported Attachment Types**: Route summarization can be applied to any hybrid attachment type that supports BGP:
   - Site-to-Site VPN
   - Connect attachments
   - Direct Connect Gateway

## 8. Filtering Peered Transit Gateways

This pattern demonstrates how Cloud WAN routing policies can be used to apply advanced routing capabilities when peering Transit Gateways with Cloud WAN. As an example, this pattern shows how to filter IPv4 routes while allowing only IPv6 connectivity between AWS Regions through peered Transit Gateways.

When migrating from Transit Gateway-based architectures to Cloud WAN, you may need to maintain existing Transit Gateway infrastructure while gradually transitioning workloads. This pattern enables you to control which routes are exchanged between Cloud WAN and peered Transit Gateways, allowing for protocol-specific connectivity or selective route filtering during migration phases.

![Filtering Peered TGWs](../../images/patterns_filtering_peered_tgws.png)

### Key Components

| Component | Configuration |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Regions** | us-east-1, eu-west-1 |
| **Segments** | `legacy` (for Transit Gateway attachments) |
| **Transit Gateways** | One in each region with dual-stack VPCs |
| **Routing Policy** | Filter all IPv4 routes (0.0.0.0/0) |
| **Policy Direction** | `inbound` (from TGW to Cloud WAN) |
| **Policy Association** | Applied via routing policy label `tgwAttachment` |

### How It Works

**Scenario**:

- Transit Gateways in us-east-1 and eu-west-1 are peered with Cloud WAN.
- Each Transit Gateway has dual-stack VPCs (IPv4 and IPv6) attached.
- Goal: Allow only IPv6 connectivity between regions through Cloud WAN, blocking all IPv4 routes.

**Solution**:

1. Create Transit Gateway peerings with Cloud WAN in both regions.
2. Attach Transit Gateway route tables to Cloud WAN using TGW route table attachments.
3. Apply routing policy label `tgwAttachment` to the TGW route table attachments.
4. Create routing policy `filterIPv4` that:
   - Matches all IPv4 routes using `prefix-in-cidr` (0.0.0.0/0)
   - Drops matched routes with `type: drop` action.
5. Associate the policy with attachments having the `tgwAttachment` label.
6. IPv6 routes pass through unfiltered, enabling cross-region IPv6 connectivity.

### Traffic Flow

| Source | Destination | Protocol | Result | Reason |
|--------|-------------|----------|--------|--------|
| us-east-1 VPC | eu-west-1 VPC | IPv4 | ❌ Blocked | IPv4 routes filtered by routing policy |
| us-east-1 VPC | eu-west-1 VPC | IPv6 | ✅ Allowed | IPv6 routes not matched by filter |
| eu-west-1 VPC | us-east-1 VPC | IPv4 | ❌ Blocked | IPv4 routes filtered by routing policy |
| eu-west-1 VPC | us-east-1 VPC | IPv6 | ✅ Allowed | IPv6 routes not matched by filter |

## Testing Routing Policies

### 1. Verify Policy Association

Check that routing policies are associated correctly in Network Manager console.

### 2. Test Route Filtering

```bash
# Check Cloud WAN route tables
aws networkmanager get-network-routes \
  --global-network-id <global-network-id> \
  --core-network-id <core-network-id> \
  --route-table-identifier <route-table-arn>

# Verify filtered routes are not present
# Verify allowed routes are present
```

### 3. Retrieve BGP Sessions and Routes per CNE

Use the `list-core-network-routing-information` API to view BGP sessions and routes announced to each CNE per segment:

```bash
# List routing information for a specific CNE and segment
aws networkmanager list-core-network-routing-information \
  --core-network-id <core-network-id> \
  --edge-location <edge-location> \
  --segment-name <segment-name>
```

This API returns:

- **BGP sessions**: Active BGP peerings with hybrid attachments
- **Route announcements**: Routes being announced to/from each CNE
- **AS-PATH information**: Complete AS-PATH for each route
- **BGP communities**: Communities attached to routes (if applicable)
- **MED (Multi-Exit Discriminator)**: Metric values for route preference
- **Local Preference**: Local preference values for path selection
